    "#### Introductory remarks\n",
    " - Geometrical spreading effect is less for surface waves than for body waves because energy spreads in 2 rather than 3 dimensions\n",
    " - Surface-wave propagation characteristics (phase and group velocity, attenuation) have been used to delineate Earth structure, and their source spectra and radiation patterns have been used to locate and study earthquakes, and for nuclear discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aims:\n",
    " - Describe basic properties of seismic surface waves traveling in a layered medium with a free surface\n",
    " - Derive formulae for amplitude and phase spectra due to arbitrary point sources\n",
    " - Represent the total wave field as a sum of normal modes and leaky modes"

    "3 general conditions for surface wave solutions:\n",

    " - Zero tractions at $z=0$ (free surface)\n",
    " - Zero amplitude at $z=\\infty$ (no energy supplied there)\n",
    "\n",
    "From these restrictions, solutions to the wave equation will take the form:\n",

    "$$ \\textbf{u}(x,y,z,t) = \\textbf{Z}(z) e^{i(kx-\\omega t)} $$\n",

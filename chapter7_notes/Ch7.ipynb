    "#### Introductory remarks\n",
    " - Geometrical spreading effect is less for surface waves than for body waves because energy spreads in 2 rather than 3 dimensions\n",
    " - Surface-wave propagation characteristics (phase and group velocity, attenuation) have been used to delineate Earth structure, and their source spectra and radiation patterns have been used to locate and study earthquakes, and for nuclear discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aims:\n",
    " - Describe basic properties of seismic surface waves traveling in a layered medium with a free surface\n",
    " - Derive formulae for amplitude and phase spectra due to arbitrary point sources\n",
    " - Represent the total wave field as a sum of normal modes and leaky modes"

    "Thus, we can determine a nontrivial solution for $l$ by finding the root of this equation for a trial value of $k$ such that $B_{21}=0$. For known $\\omega$ and $k$, on can calculate the value of $B_{21}$ by matmul through $w=Bl$ for a layer's parameters. Then k is changed slightly, and the resulting change in $B_{21}$ is monitored. Once the eigenvalue is found, the eigenfunction can be calculated using the propagator matrices...So this is basically just imposing another condition on the solution.\n",

    "A similar approach can be extended to Rayleigh waves by finding a relation between the motion-stress vector $(r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4)$ and the displacement amplitudes $(P',S',P'',S'')$ describing the presence of each waves in the P-SV system for each layer."
